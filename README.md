# Control of the ABB robot through B&R Automation PLC - EGM (Externally Guided Motion)

Externally-guided motion (or EGM) is an interface for ABB robots to allow smooth control of a robotic arm from an external PC.  EGM can be used to stream positions to a robot controller in either joint space or cartesian space. 

EGM.cs is autogenerated code from the egm.proto -file.

EGMSensor needs to be defined under Configuration Editor - Communication - Transmission Protocol. The parameters are:

Name	Type	Serial Port	Remote Adress	Remote port number
EGMSensor	UDPUC	N/A	Computers IP	6510
