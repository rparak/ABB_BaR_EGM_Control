# Control of the ABB robot through B&R Automation PLC - EGM (Externally Guided Motion)

Externally-guided motion (or EGM) is an interface for ABB robots to allow smooth control of a robotic arm from an external PC.  EGM can be used to stream positions to a robot controller in either joint space or cartesian space.
